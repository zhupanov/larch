# rebase-push.sh — Rebase onto origin/main and optionally force-push with lease.
#
# Fetches origin/main, rebases, and (unless --no-push) pushes. Reports
# conflicts and push failures via exit codes.
#
# Usage:
#   rebase-push.sh [--continue] [--no-push [--skip-if-pushed]]
#
# Flags:
#   --continue       — Continue an in-progress rebase instead of starting a new
#                      one. Skips fetch and runs `git rebase --continue` instead
#                      of `git rebase origin/main`. Caller must resolve conflicts
#                      and stage files before invoking with --continue.
#   --no-push        — Skip the push step after a successful rebase. Used by
#                      /implement-and-merge for local-only freshness rebases
#                      where the branch has not yet been pushed. In this mode,
#                      conflicts are aborted immediately (exit 1) instead of
#                      left in progress.
#   --skip-if-pushed — Only valid with --no-push. Before fetching, check whether
#                      the current branch already exists on origin. If it does,
#                      print `SKIPPED_ALREADY_PUSHED=true` to stdout and exit 0
#                      without fetching or rebasing. This lets /implement-and-merge
#                      collapse its per-checkpoint "is branch pushed? if so skip,
#                      else rebase" dance into a single script invocation. If the
#                      ls-remote check fails (network/auth), the script falls
#                      through to the normal rebase path so the subsequent fetch
#                      surfaces the real error.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — rebase (and push, unless --no-push) succeeded, OR skipped because
#       --skip-if-pushed detected the branch already on origin
#   1 — rebase failed with conflicts
#       Default mode: rebase left in progress (CONFLICT_FILES= on stdout)
#       --no-push mode: rebase aborted, branch restored to pre-rebase state
#   2 — push --force-with-lease failed (PUSH_ERROR= on stderr, caller should retry after fetch)
#       Not possible in --no-push mode.
#   3 — rebase failed for non-conflict reasons (REBASE_ERROR= on stderr), OR
#       invalid flag combination (e.g., --skip-if-pushed without --no-push)
#       In normal mode: rebase is aborted.
#       In --continue mode: rebase is left in progress (caller can inspect/retry).
#       In --no-push mode: rebase is aborted.
#
# Stdout on exit 0 when --skip-if-pushed skipped the rebase:
#   SKIPPED_ALREADY_PUSHED=true
#
# Stdout on exit 1 (default mode only):
#   CONFLICT_FILES=<comma-separated list of conflicted files>
#
# Note: On exit 1 in default mode, the rebase is left in progress so the
# caller can resolve conflicts and run `rebase-push.sh --continue`. On exit 1
# in --no-push mode, the rebase is aborted (caller does not resolve conflicts).
# On exit 3 in normal mode, the rebase is aborted. On exit 3 in --continue
# mode, the rebase is left in progress to avoid destroying already-resolved work.
