# Eval Workflow: Running and Evaluating Test Cases

All paths in this document are relative to the skill root directory (`skill-creator/`).

This section is one continuous sequence — do not stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.

Put results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Create directories as you go.

## Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn

For each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.

**Baseline caching (iteration 2+):** If baseline results from the previous iteration exist at `<workspace>/iteration-<N-1>/eval-<ID>/without_skill/` (or `old_skill/`), **reuse them** instead of re-running. Copy the previous baseline directory into the current iteration. Only re-run baselines if the baseline configuration changed (e.g., new eval prompts, different model). This avoids redundant baseline runs that produce identical results across iterations.

**With-skill run:**

```
Execute this task:
- Skill path: <path-to-skill>
- Task: <eval prompt>
- Input files: <eval files if any, or "none">
- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/run-1/outputs/
- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., "the .docx file", "the final CSV">
```

**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):
- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/run-1/outputs/`.
- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/run-1/outputs/`.

Write an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it tests — not just "eval-0". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create fresh metadata files — do not assume they carry over from previous iterations.

```json
{
  "eval_id": 0,
  "eval_name": "descriptive-name-here",
  "prompt": "The user's task prompt",
  "assertions": []
}
```

## Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions

Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.

Good assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — do not force assertions onto things that need human judgment.

Update the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Explain to the user what they will see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.

## Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data

When each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory (e.g., `with_skill/run-1/timing.json`):

```json
{
  "total_tokens": 84852,
  "duration_ms": 23332,
  "total_duration_seconds": 23.3
}
```

This is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and is not persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives.

## Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer

Once all runs are done:

1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory (e.g., `with_skill/run-1/grading.json`). The expectations array must use `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details`) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and reusable across iterations.

2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:
   ```bash
   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>
   ```
   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean +/- stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects. Put each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.

3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the "Analyzing Benchmark Results" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.

4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:
   ```bash
   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \
     <workspace>/iteration-N \
     --skill-name "my-skill" \
     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   VIEWER_PID=$!
   ```
   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.

   **Headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks "Submit All Reviews". Copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.

5. **Tell the user**: "I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know."

### What the user sees in the viewer

The "Outputs" tab shows one test case at a time:
- **Prompt**: the task that was given
- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible
- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output
- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail
- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type
- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox

The "Benchmark" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.

Navigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click "Submit All Reviews" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.

## Step 5: Read the feedback

When the user says they are done, read `feedback.json`:

```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {"run_id": "eval-0-with_skill-run-1", "feedback": "the chart is missing axis labels", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-1-with_skill-run-1", "feedback": "", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-2-with_skill-run-1", "feedback": "perfect, love this", "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
```

Empty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.

Kill the viewer server when done:

```bash
kill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null
```
