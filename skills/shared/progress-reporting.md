# Progress Reporting Contract

Shared formatting rules for step progress output across all larch skills. Each skill maintains its own **Step Name Registry** (mapping step numbers to short names) and references this contract for formatting.

## Breadcrumb Format

Every progress line follows:

```
{icon} {step_number}: {breadcrumb_path}[ — {payload}]
```

- **`{icon}`**: One of the icons below, indicating the line type.
- **`{step_number}`**: The full numeric step designation including any parent prefix (e.g., `1.2a.5` when `/design` step `2a.5` is called from `/implement` step `1`).
- **`{breadcrumb_path}`**: Human-readable path from root to current step, segments joined by ` | `. Built from `STEP_PATH_PREFIX | step_short_name` when nested, or just `step_short_name` when standalone.
- **`{payload}`**: Optional description, outcome, or reason — appended after ` — `.

## Icon Taxonomy

| Icon | Line type | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `🔶` | Step start | Entering a new step |
| `✅` | Completion | Step completed with informational payload |
| `⏩` | Sub-step skip | Optimization or workflow-conditional skip (quick mode, no changes, etc.) |
| `⏭️` | Precondition skip | Entire step skipped due to missing precondition (repo unavailable, Slack not configured, merge not set) |
| `⚠` | Warning | Non-fatal issue within a step |
| `🔃` | Rebase | Rebase-related operation |
| `⏳` | Intermediate | Progress update within a long-running step |
| `⚡` | Quick mode | Special quick-mode announcements |

**Semantic distinction**: `⏩` and `⏭️` are intentionally separate. `⏩` indicates a lightweight skip within the normal flow; `⏭️` indicates a precondition failure that causes an entire major step to be bypassed.

## Step Start Formatting

Step start lines (`🔶`) get special visual treatment to make them easy to spot:

1. **Separator line**: Print a line of 80 `━` characters immediately before every step start line.
2. **Bold text**: Render the entire step start line in bold using `**...**` markdown.
3. **Blockquote**: Wrap the bold line in a markdown blockquote (`>`) for color differentiation.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 2: implementation**
```

Only `🔶` step start lines get the separator, blockquote, and bold treatment. Completion (`✅`), skip (`⏩`/`⏭️`), warning (`⚠`), and other lines do NOT get separators, blockquotes, or bold.

## Elapsed Time

Every line that marks the **end** of a step or work item must include elapsed time — whether it completed successfully, was skipped, failed, or timed out. This applies to: `✅`, `⏩`, `⏭️`, and step-ending `⚠` lines.

**Step-ending `⚠`** means any `⚠` that contains a step-number prefix (e.g., `⚠ 7a: ...`, `⚠ 14: ...`). Unnumbered bail lines (e.g., `⚠ Rebase onto main failed. Bailing to cleanup.`) do not require elapsed time.

### Step progress lines

Append the elapsed time in parentheses at the end of the line, using short form. The timer starts when the step logically began (its `🔶` start line, or entry into the step if no `🔶` line exists).

```
✅ 2a.5: dialectic — 3 decisions resolved (1m42s)
⏩ 6: checks (2) — skipped, no review changes (1s)
⏭️ 12: CI+merge loop — skipped (--merge not set) (0s)
⚠ 7a: code flow — generation failed, proceeding without diagram (12s)
```

### Compact status tables (`📊` lines)

For reviewer/agent status tables, include elapsed time immediately after each `✅` and `❌`. The timer for each entry starts when that agent/reviewer was launched.

Voting-Protocol skills (`/design`, `/review`, `/implement` Phase 3 conflict review) use the 3-reviewer composition:

```
📊 Reviewers: | Code: ✅ 2m31s | Codex: ⏳ | Cursor: ✅ 4m12s |
```

Negotiation-Protocol skill `/loop-review` uses a 5-lane composition:

```
📊 Reviewers: | Code-broad: ✅ 2m31s | Code-deep: ⏳ | Codex-G: ✅ 4m12s | Codex-D: ❌ 8m3s | Cursor: ⏳ |
```

Negotiation-Protocol skill `/research` uses a 3-lane composition in each phase (Phase 1 research; Phase 2 validation):

```
📊 Agents: | Claude: ✅ 2m31s | Cursor: ⏳ | Codex: ✅ 3m5s |
📊 Reviewers: | Codex-G: ✅ 2m31s | Codex-D: ⏳ | Cursor: ✅ 4m12s |
```

Claude fallback lanes appear in place of an unavailable external (e.g., `Code (generic)` for Cursor, or `Code-broad`/`Code-deep` for Codex).

`⏳` (in-progress) and `⊘` (skipped/unavailable) do not include timing.

### Time format

Use the shortest representation:
- Under 1 minute: `45s`
- 1–59 minutes: `2m31s`
- 1+ hours: `1h3m` (seconds are always omitted in the hours tier)

Omit zero components: use `2m` not `2m0s`, use `1h` not `1h0m`.

## `--step-prefix` Encoding

When a parent skill invokes a child skill (e.g., `/implement` → `/design`), it passes step context via `--step-prefix` using this encoding:

```
--step-prefix "NUM_PREFIX::TEXT_PATH"
```

- **`NUM_PREFIX`**: The numeric prefix to prepend to the child's step numbers (e.g., `"1."` means child step `2a` becomes `1.2a`).
- **`TEXT_PATH`**: The human-readable breadcrumb segment(s) from the parent (e.g., `"design plan"`).
- **Delimiter**: Split on the first `::` to separate numeric from textual parts.
- **Backward compatibility**: If `::` is absent, treat the entire value as a numeric-only prefix. The text path defaults to empty — breadcrumbs show only the leaf step name.

### Parsing in child skills

Child skills parse `--step-prefix` into two mental variables:

- `STEP_NUM_PREFIX`: Everything before the first `::` (or the entire value if `::` absent).
- `STEP_PATH_PREFIX`: Everything after the first `::` (or empty if `::` absent).

When outputting a step:

- **Step number**: `{STEP_NUM_PREFIX}{local_step_number}` (e.g., `1.` + `2a.5` = `1.2a.5`)
- **Breadcrumb path**: If `STEP_PATH_PREFIX` is non-empty: `{STEP_PATH_PREFIX} | {step_short_name}`. Otherwise: just `{step_short_name}`.

### Examples

Standalone `/design` (no `--step-prefix`):
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 2a: sketches**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 2a.5: dialectic**
✅ 2a.5: dialectic — 3 decisions resolved (1m42s)
```

`/design` called from `/implement` with `--step-prefix "1.::design plan"`:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 1.2a: design plan | sketches**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 1.2a.5: design plan | dialectic**
✅ 1.2a.5: design plan | dialectic — 3 decisions resolved (1m42s)
```

`/review` called from `/implement` with `--step-prefix "5.::code review"`:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 5.2: code review | launch reviewers**
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
> **🔶 5.3: code review | review cycle**
```

## Section headers and structured output

Do NOT prefix section headers (e.g., `## Implementation Plan`), structured output headers, artifact labels, or compact reviewer status tables with breadcrumb formatting. Breadcrumbs apply only to progress status lines.
